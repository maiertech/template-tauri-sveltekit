# template-tauri-sveltekit

This is a [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/) GitHub template, which uses
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as its frontend.

## Updating dependencies

### Tauri

Run

```bash
pnpm create tauri-app .
```

from the project root to update dependencies.

### SvelteKit

The SvelteKit app bootstrapped by Tauri does not come with ESLint and Prettier. I added them
manually. You can update the SvelteKit part separately by running

```bash
pnpm create sveltekit@latest .
```

Follow the instructions in
[template-sveltekit-example](https://github.com/maiertech/template-sveltekit-example). But you need
to review changed files because this command overrides some of the files generated by Tauri.

## adapter-static

Tauri generates a SvelteKit app with [adapter-static](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static).
In combination with Tauri, you cannot use SvelteKit's server-side features. In a Tauri app, anything
that SvelteKit would handle server-side, should be handled by Tauri's Rust backend.

Normally, you use adapter-static with these two settings in `/src/routes/+layout.ts`:

- `prerender = true`: Generate an HTML page for each route. You can enter the application through
  each generated page and fromt there the app will be hydrated.
- `ssr = true`: Server-side render all pages at build time. This means that the HTML pages are
  rendered at build time. Otherwise they would be empty and rendered client-side.

In combination with Tauri, you have to set `ssr = false` because Tauri requires acccess to `window`,
which is not availalbe during SSR. You could set `ssr = true` but then you would have to use
client-side checks before using Tauri's API.

To create a true SPA app, we would also need to set `prerender = false`. Then we need to set a
fallback page.
